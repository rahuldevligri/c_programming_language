00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,644
Now, let's see.

3
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:06,357
After you decide that
I'm depressed, or whatever,

4
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,901
you'll put me on meds, right?

5
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,988
And I know
hundreds of people on them

6
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,532
and they're all doing just fine.
Really.

7
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,330
I'll go back to work
on my new anti-depressants.

8
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,332
I'll have dinner with my parents

9
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,877
and persuade them
I'm back to being the normal one

10
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,129
who never gives them any trouble.

11
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:40,308
And one day some guy
will ask me to marry him.

12
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,855
He'll be nice enough.
That'll make my parents very happy.

13
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,283
The first year
we'll make love all the time,

14
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,287
and in the second and third
less and less.

15
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:07,043
But just as we're getting sick
of each other, I'll get pregnant.

16
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,466
Taking care of kids,
holding onto jobs, paying mortgages...

17
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,677
It'll keep us
on an even keel for a while.

18
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:22,433
Then about ten years into it
he'll have an affair

19
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,728
because I'm too busy
and I'm too tired.

20
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,567
And I'll find out.

21
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:35,071
I'll threaten to kill him,
his mistress,

22
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,240
myself.

23
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,660
We'll get past it.

24
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,622
A few years later
he'll have another one.

25
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,166
This time I'm just going to pretend
that I don't know because...

26
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,253
somehow kicking up a fuss just doesn't
seem worth the trouble this time.

27
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,090
And I'll live out the rest of my days

28
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,928
sometimes wishing my kids
could have the life that I never had.

29
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,183
Other times secretly pleased
they're turning into repeats of me.

30
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,234
I'm fine. Really.

31
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,500
Green is not the new black.

32
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,921
Hasn't anyone else noticed that
everyone has gone totally insane?

33
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:06,884
Why are we all so afraid
to look at things as they really are?

34
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,553
Slogans like this have succeeded
in distracting us all

35
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,972
from the things that really matter.

36
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,974
There's no other escape.

37
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,228
I want people to know
that I'm killing myself

38
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,397
rather than participate in the
collective madness of this world

39
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,399
we are all living in.

40
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,653
This is not the real world.

41
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,364
Goodbye.

42
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,902
Open this!

43
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,836
Hurry, call 911!

44
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,391
Needle is going in.

45
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,021
She's at 100 over 60.
- Let's get that BP up!

46
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,315
It's dropping fast.
It's at 80 over 40.

47
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,401
Let's get her inside!
- Prepare the patient for ACLS.

48
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,355
Could you please
send in my 9:15?

49
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,430
Edward!

50
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,239
Come on now, Edward.

51
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,803
I wanted to let you know

52
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,640
that your father's annual visit
is scheduled for next week.

53
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,648
He'll be asking me
if you've made any progress.

54
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,029
Have you made any progress, Edward?

55
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,622
You know, Villette works for the great
majority of people who come here.

56
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,543
The last two times
your father visited

57
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,922
I suggested
he bring you home, but...

58
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,673
Well...

59
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,677
I'm certain he believes
you being here is for the best.

60
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,683
What do you think of that, Edward?

61
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,983
Nurse!

62
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,406
Relax. We're going to
take good care of you.

63
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,328
Relax.

64
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,291
There we go.

65
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,419
Good. Good girl.

66
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,280
Veronika...

67
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,118
You were in a coma
in intensive care for two weeks

68
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,412
before being well enough
to be with us here.

69
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,124
Where am I?

70
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,169
Villette.

71
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,172
Villette?

72
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,427
A privately funded psychiatric
facility on the Hudson River.

73
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,681
Our director Dr. Blake has taken
a special interest in your case.

74
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,642
You're shrinks...

75
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,356
Why am I here?
Who put me here?

76
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,734
Your parents approved it.

77
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,322
Veronika,
can I ask you a few questions?

78
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,824
Your date of birth?

79
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,745
December 24th, 2000-

80
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,168
1981.

81
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,671
Your address?

82
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,137
Your place of employment?

83
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,516
Freeman Stanley.

84
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,228
Your position?

85
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,566
Assistant Accounts Executive.

86
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,278
Seventy five thousand a year plus
additional health benefits included.

87
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,742
The color of your mother's hair?

88
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,630
I don't remember.

89
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,217
The color of my hair?

90
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,096
Blonde.

91
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,058
Are you sure?

92
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,023
"Deklava" is Slovenian?

93
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,903
Your parents are-
- My parents left before I was born.

94
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,574
We get along just fine,
if that's what you're wondering.

95
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,997
Look, how long do I
have to stay here?

96
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:03,253
Unfortunately, we have some
difficult news in that regard.

97
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,885
Does somebody want to tell me
what's going on?

98
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,647
That's yours.
- Oh.

99
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:31,448
Veronika, when you took the overdose
your heart stopped.

100
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:36,453
And you suffered a heart attack
which caused a ventricular aneurysm.

101
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,997
In layman's terms,

102
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,334
you have damaged the mechanism
that pumps blood into the heart

103
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,961
which has caused
irreversible damage to it.

104
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:51,802
The heart attack produced a scar
which in time became an aneurysm.

105
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:56,431
I'm afraid the aneurysm
is so large it's inoperable.

106
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,688
It will get bigger and bigger
every day, until it finally ruptures.

107
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,409
So I'm going to die after all?

108
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,286
I'm afraid so.

109
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,127
Well, how long do I have?

110
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,504
A year? Years?

111
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,050
Exact estimates are impossible.

112
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,094
Not years.

113
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,516
Okay, so six months?
Five months? Four months?

114
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,812
It could be any time.

115
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,609
It may only be a matter
of weeks, at most.

116
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,739
I have to wait that long?

117
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,325
Well...

118
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,246
If I succeeded,
why don't you just kill me now?

119
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,916
This might be too much
for you to take in.

120
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,002
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

121
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,629
I think we've said enough for now.

122
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,010
We think this is
the best place for you.

123
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,721
We'll be giving you
regular shots for your heart

124
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,348
which may make you feel
a little tired.

125
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,852
But we'll do everything we can
to make your last days here

126
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,772
as pleasant as possible.

127
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,525
Do my parents know?

128
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,153
No. No, not yet.

129
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,864
You can't tell them.

130
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,702
I think we've said enough for now.

131
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,669
Natasha, would you please...
- Yes, Doctor.

132
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:50,540
860, 861, 862,

133
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:55,211
863, 864, 865.

134
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,382
There you are. Better?

135
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,348
I'm your roommate, Claire.

136
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,908
This place isn't so bad, you know.

137
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,202
They have really good drugs.

138
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,289
I'm leaving any day now,

139
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,751
but not before I have
one more round of my coma treatment.

140
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,008
You're really pretty.

141
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm going to tell you
the trick of this place.

142
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a story.

143
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,211
Once upon a time

144
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,341
there was a powerful wizard
who wanted to destroy a whole kingdom.

145
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,053
And to do this he poured
a magic potion into the well

146
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,597
from which all the citizens drank.

147
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,726
Anyone who tasted it would go mad.

148
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,352
And the King,

149
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,773
when he saw his people so changed
he was terrified.

150
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:44,487
He was preparing to leave the city
when the Queen stopped him,

151
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:49,075
saying,
"Let us drink from the well,

152
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,454
we'll be the same as they are."

153
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:58,084
And so they drank
from the communal well of madness

154
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:02,422
and they were immediately
as insane as their subjects.

155
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:08,094
And so the King was allowed
to continue ruling in peace

156
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,472
for the rest of his days.

157
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,394
So...

158
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,357
learn to think
as those around you think

159
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,110
and you can pass yourself off
as anything.

160
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,323
You think outsiders
are any less crazy than we are?

161
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,284
I'm not crazy.

162
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,164
Are you really going to die?

163
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,000
Who told you that?

164
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,545
Oh, you know. The talk.
Talk, talk.

165
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,714
Blah, blah, talk, talk.

166
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,552
I don't want to wait.

167
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,183
Do you know how I could
get my hands on something?

168
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,977
Really?

169
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,276
Come have a smoke with me.

170
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,238
No thanks.
- Oh, come on.

171
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,490
Get dressed.

172
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,243
You don't want them
to think you're crazy.

173
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,641
You want to come
outside with me, Ed?

174
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,992
Ask Mari, she'll tell you
how to get the pills.

175
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,996
She's been here the longest
out of all the patients.

176
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,419
Her clique has the best deal here.

177
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,088
They don't have to take their meds
unless they feel like it.

178
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,801
She was a lawyer on the outside
and she was married to one too.

179
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:16,514
And then she lost her job and she
had a breakdown and she ended up here.

180
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,558
Her marriage is over too.

181
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,603
And she's really close to Dr. Blake.

182
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,397
You think she'll help me?

183
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,566
I don't know.

184
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:31,154
If she doesn't want to
talk to you, she won't.

185
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,044
What about him?

186
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,421
Ed.

187
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,382
I know. He's gorgeous.

188
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,927
You can't actually talk to him.

189
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,054
Mari has a way with him,

190
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,223
but no one else.

191
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,310
He was dumped here a few years ago.

192
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,395
Years?

193
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,648
That's what happens.

194
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,567
He was in an accident

195
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,655
and then by the time he was fixed
he had stopped talking.

196
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,491
His girlfriend
was in the car with him.

197
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,660
She died instantly.

198
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,995
And he thinks he killed her.

199
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,793
What do they say is wrong with him?
- Oh God, it changes all the time.

200
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,754
Catatonia, schizo, all these names.

201
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:33,967
No use getting interested in him.
He doesn't care about anybody.

202
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,679
I'm not interested in anyone either.

203
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,683
Not even me?

204
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,727
I'm freezing.

205
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,528
Hey! Hey!
Do you know what astral travel is?

206
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,322
I do it in my coma treatment.

207
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,366
I haven't reached the moon yet,
but I will.

208
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,202
I'm having my last treatment
in the next couple of days.

209
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,621
You can come watch if you want.

210
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,719
How are you?

211
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,813
Your parents are waiting outside.

212
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,316
No!

213
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,945
I can't see them.

214
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,948
No, I won't see them.

215
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,826
But they want to see you.
They've come all this way.

216
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,039
Did you tell them?

217
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,082
No.

218
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:53,129
No, you told me not to.
I thought I'd leave that up to you.

219
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,800
How can I tell them?

220
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,851
I think you should see them.

221
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,951
Can someone please send in
Mr. and Mrs. Deklava.

222
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:41,677
Veronika always had good grades
and made friends with nice people.

223
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,224
Always had good-paying jobs.

224
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:51,145
Never had a speck
of trouble with her. Never.

225
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,689
She...

226
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:58,903
You always made us very proud.

227
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,786
Doctor, how do you
make her get better?

228
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,704
I mean...

229
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,916
back to normal.

230
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,085
He's a good Doctor...

231
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,423
Well...

232
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:23,094
You see, first of all,
your daughter tried to kill herself.

233
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,680
Now, that's nothing
for you to be ashamed of.

234
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,601
In our society
we feel we must be happy.

235
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,771
If we're not happy we feel hopeless.
We feel like failures.

236
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,406
The plan is to talk
with Veronika, mainly.

237
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,408
Talk?

238
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,711
Dad, how much are they
over-charging you for this place?

239
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,338
Oh, it's nothing. Forget it.

240
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,425
The most important thing
is your health now.

241
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,512
Of course it would be better
if you stayed home with us

242
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,930
and rest with us, but-

243
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:12,560
Sometimes, being away from everyone,
even loved ones,

244
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,104
can help people get calm.

245
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,650
This place is worth it.

246
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,363
I even noticed on the way here
they have a nice piano.

247
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,578
You play piano?
- No.

248
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:34,749
Oh yes, doctor, she-
- She used to play lovely.

249
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:39,879
Mozart, Bach, Debussy.
- Yeah, yeah.

250
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,215
Every teacher said she has a gift.

251
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,634
It doesn't matter,
I don't play anymore.

252
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,385
It's nothing.

253
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,056
She even had a scholarship
from the Juilliard.

254
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,976
But we agreed it was better for her
to go to a proper school,

255
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,102
so that she-

256
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,523
So she would never be lacking in
for a good-paying job.

257
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,651
Could we not have
this conversation please?

258
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,778
We just want you to be happy.

259
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,239
Could we just not!

260
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,784
I'm sorry.

261
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,412
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay. It's okay...

262
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,751
I'm sorry...

263
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,007
Veronika.

264
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:33,140
There's nothing else you want to say
while your parents are still here?

265
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,818
Are you sure?

266
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,534
Well, it's a long drive
back to Brooklyn.

267
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,495
You'll want to beat
the rush hour traffic.

268
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,293
Yeah, I guess...

269
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:05,464
getting back to Brooklyn
at this hour could be horrible.

270
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,076
Listen...

271
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,958
When Dr. Blake says it's okay,

272
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:47,423
you'll come home,
you'll spend some time with us.

273
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,592
Okay?

274
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,777
Thank you.
- Goodbye.

275
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,820
See you soon. Bye-bye.

276
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,117
This is it?

277
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,087
There she is.

278
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,340
You gave us a start, young lady.

279
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:21,225
We're going to try adjusting
the dosage on your medication.

280
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,293
This is about a woman's life.

281
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,379
We wouldn't even be having this
conversation if she had succeeded.

282
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,048
But luckily she didn't,

283
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,509
but we're talking about
a woman's life.

284
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,260
The fashion industry

285
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,305
has suffered attacks from
nut jobs like this all the time!

286
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,349
I'm sorry, it is fair!

287
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,768
Nutty as a fruitcake!

288
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,530
Nutty as a fruitcake!

289
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:08,374
Well?
Aren't you going to react at all?

290
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:14,380
No. You won't be with us
much longer, little one.

291
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,943
The good thing about
being in a crazy hospital

292
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,363
is that you can get away with
slapping Fred when he talks like that.

293
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,659
I was looking for you.

294
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,287
Claire said that you might...

295
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,832
... be someone who can help you?

296
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,793
I need pills.

297
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,715
I want to die on my own terms.

298
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,767
When those two geniuses switch off
shifts at the end of the day,

299
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,645
about dinner time, around 7,

300
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,899
there's usually a moment
when that door is unwatched.

301
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,485
I don't understand.

302
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,488
The medicine closet.

303
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,384
How can you stand it here?

304
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,970
Edward!

305
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,600
Edward!

306
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,982
Edward, come on.

307
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,526
It's time for your treatment.

308
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,986
Come on.

309
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,322
Come on.

310
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,453
Edward, come on.

311
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,879
Dinner time!

312
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,840
Dinner time.

313
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,300
Come on, come on.

314
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,885
Thank you.

315
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,152
Hey, George! This way!

316
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,227
Veronika! Get away from that water!
No! Spit it out!

317
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,564
Out! All of it! Come on!

318
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,608
Come on! All of it!

319
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,985
All of it. Is that all?

320
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,408
Look at me.
Alright? Come on.

321
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,619
Let's get her to Dr. Blake.

322
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:26,006
So you really thought it would be
that easy to steal some pills?

323
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,424
You're a shit.

324
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,219
Because I won't cooperate
in you killing yourself?

325
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,263
Because you love playing
with people's souls.

326
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,518
I hate you.

327
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:40,646
Really? Tell me about it.

328
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,526
Fine.

329
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,402
I hate your stupid desk.

330
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,739
And I hate your ugly ties.

331
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,450
And I hate your ridiculous socks.

332
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,328
And I hate everyone
locked up in this place.

333
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,956
And I hate my parents
for spending their very last penny

334
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,749
to keep me in this zoo.

335
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:04,711
God forbid they should ever,
for one moment, live their own lives.

336
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,421
Is that what they came here for?

337
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,882
To be the fucking same
as everybody else?

338
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,802
And I hate the jerks
in my office who think

339
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,138
the money they earn
makes them "the shit".

340
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,266
And more than anything
I hate the zombies on the subway

341
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,184
who have forgotten
all of their dreams

342
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,271
or the fact that they
ever had any to begin with.

343
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,569
I have some terrifying news for you.

344
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,198
What could be more
terrifying than this?

345
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,035
You sound like you
might be feeling better.

346
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,873
Answer me honestly, please.

347
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,752
Doesn't it feel better
to feel better?

348
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:53,510
Have you ever heard the story
of the King and the poisoned well?

349
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,264
You mean Claire's absurd story?

350
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,766
Do you think she invented it?

351
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,937
Oh, I should have guessed this one.

352
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,608
That's your brilliant take on reality?

353
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,946
Well, reality is what
the majority deem it to be.

354
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,157
Not necessarily the best
or the most logical,

355
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:19,036
but the one that has become adapted to
the desires of a society as a whole.

356
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,371
Some things
are governed by common sense,

357
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,748
and others become fixed

358
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,375
until more and more people believe
that's the way it should be.

359
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:29,338
Like the Qwerty keyboard.
Do you know why it's like that?

360
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,632
I haven't really had the time
to give it much thought.

361
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,133
Well...

362
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,761
when the typewriter
was first invented,

363
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,597
the letters were arranged
in alphabetical order.

364
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:42,643
Now, when a person typed too quickly
the keys became jammed.

365
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:46,772
So this man, Scholes,
he invented the Qwerty keyboard,

366
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:50,651
whereby people were obliged
to type more slowly.

367
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,822
And?

368
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,033
Well, it's...

369
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,369
it's a true story.

370
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,956
You are batshit crazy,
you know that?

371
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,042
You sell these patients
on this optimistic belief

372
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,711
that they're no different
than the people on the outside,

373
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,964
because they're no different than you!

374
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,675
Well, I consider that
a simple matter of fact.

375
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:19,304
Only a truly crazy person would
call it reassuring or optimistic.

376
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,598
Besides,

377
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,018
aren't you the one
who accused the fashion industry

378
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,939
of foisting pathological,
dehumanizing values on our society?

379
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,943
Well, I was high when I wrote that.

380
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,863
Then I take it, an ad campaign

381
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,367
was not the real reason
you tried to kill yourself.

382
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,036
I had a point.

383
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,039
You almost laughed.

384
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,251
Another sign of improvement.

385
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,461
Go to hell!

386
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,083
She is beginning to experience
the reality of death

387
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,711
as something
beyond her control.

388
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,255
Edward's noticed her.

389
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,175
Whatever that means with Edward.

390
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,177
Have you grown
so attached to your guilt

391
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,138
about the fix you're in with Edward

392
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,849
that you can't see yourself
living without it?

393
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,268
Is it that you're
so close to leaving

394
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:02,522
you want to construct a happy ending
for Edward to match your own?

395
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,483
I don't think Edward
being interested in a suicidal girl

396
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,862
with a few days to live
is much of a happy ending.

397
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,739
Perhaps you're a little jealous.

398
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,782
You mean
"a little counter transference"?

399
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,453
Just because it's a cliché
doesn't mean it isn't true.

400
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:22,083
Anyway, who says I'm ready to go?

401
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:33,261
In order to lose someone

402
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:37,098
you must first experience
authentic attachment.

403
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,727
Now, if Edward could
recover normal affect

404
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:44,147
to the point where he'd
be capable of genuine loss,

405
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,609
I think I'd consider that
my finest hour as a doctor.

406
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,942
You're free to go.

407
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,782
Okay, Claire,
I'm going to swab you down.

408
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,662
Here we go.

409
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,123
120 over 80.
- Good.

410
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,047
Her numbers are looking good.
- Very good.

411
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,549
Okay. She's in.

412
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:19,928
Here we go.

413
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,642
I'm okay.

414
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,230
100 over 60.

415
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,420
One of your patients,
Veronika Deklava,

416
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,341
is getting considerable media play
from some rather unfair things

417
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:01,761
she said about
part of our advertising campaign.

418
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,098
Of course,
our first and foremost concern

419
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,892
is for the well-being
of the young lady.

420
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,062
Well, now she's a patient
undergoing active treatment here,

421
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,606
the details of her condition
are confidential.

422
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:19,028
But she is recovered enough
for a well-wisher to pay his respects?

423
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:23,533
Look, you want to put Veronika
into some sort of dog-and-pony show?

424
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,119
That's not going to happen.

425
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,122
We're under a great deal
of pressure over this matter,

426
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,915
as I'm sure you understand.

427
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,918
I'm sorry, she's not available
to be put on display.

428
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:41,551
We've made some enquiries
with the State Board of Health

429
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,470
that gives you
your license to operate.

430
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:49,350
Apparently three years ago
a patient died here?

431
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,477
Of a drug overdose?

432
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,938
And the families of other patients

433
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,650
have complained about
irregular methods of treatment.

434
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,614
What the families of patients
complain about, by and large,

435
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,491
is that not every
mentally ill person can be cured.

436
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:09,662
Now, what is it exactly
you want from me?

437
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:13,750
You have very unorthodox methods,
Dr. Blake.

438
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:20,381
I can shine a spotlight on the unusual
activities taking place up here.

439
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,428
I have absolutely nothing to hide.

440
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:46,532
274, 275, 276, 277,

441
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:51,329
278, 279, 280,

442
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:56,334
281, 282, 283.

443
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,461
Claire, honey.

444
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,547
Come on,
you haven't been released.

445
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:06,636
Okay, lets get your bags
and we'll go sit in the day room.

446
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,433
Okay, I'll go get Dr. Thompson.

447
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:15,353
She's gonna come down
and talk with you, okay?

448
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,734
No, not now, Edward.

449
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,030
I don't really feel like playing.

450
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,197
You okay?

451
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,328
I'll get to the moon next time,

452
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,081
and they'll let me leave.

453
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,812
Hey.
- You okay?

454
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:07,024
You should be careful.
- It doesn't really matter, does it?

455
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,783
There's an expert in Sufi spiritual
teaching talking to us tonight.

456
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:20,746
Some people find Sufi spirituality
very beautiful. And helpful.

457
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,583
Some don't.

458
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,925
I don't think
you should leave this life

459
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,052
without knowing how far you can go.

460
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:18,447
Insanity is the inability
to communicate our ideas.

461
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:23,661
So all of us are
to one degree or another insane.

462
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,999
But don't confuse insanity
with a loss of control.

463
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,042
You have two choices:

464
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:35,298
To control your mind
or to let your mind control you.

465
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:06,115
And allow the real "I"
to reveal itself.

466
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:11,537
The real "I" is what you are,

467
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,790
not what others make of you.

468
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:01,141
I could fall in love
with you right now.

469
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:09,191
And I know you won't say anything.

470
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,905
But that's okay.

471
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,991
It's very early.

472
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:42,826
I need to talk to you.

473
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,996
I need your help.

474
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,417
You didn't have
your injection last night.

475
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,629
I know. I'm feeling much better.

476
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,467
Well, you don't look it.

477
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:04,431
If you want to make the most
of the time you have left,

478
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,558
you'll do as I say.

479
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,232
I do want to.

480
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:18,070
And that's why I need to know exactly
how much time I have left.

481
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:24,159
I've told you,
I can't be sure.

482
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:27,788
Everything is happening
as I anticipated.

483
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,710
Dr. Blake, I need you
to do two things for me.

484
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:38,465
I need a shot or something
so that I can stay awake.

485
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,385
I want to be conscious
of every moment.

486
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,347
What's the other thing?

487
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,269
I want to leave here.

488
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,729
No, no, no, no, no.

489
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,941
You can't just go,
you're not well enough.

490
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,360
Besides you're under my care.

491
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,281
You're looking very pale.

492
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,992
I'm tired, that's all.

493
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:09,037
Look, if I have even
a little time left,

494
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,456
there's so much I could do.

495
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,375
I want to go the beach.

496
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:17,004
I want to see the ocean
and I want to feel the sand.

497
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:21,049
I want to have a huge taco
from my favorite taco stand.

498
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:24,761
I want to walk into an Irish pub
and I want to order a Guinness.

499
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,306
I've never done that.

500
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,600
I want to see my mom.

501
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,352
I want to talk to her,
really talk to her.

502
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:36,982
Look, get some rest and conserve
what little energy you have left.

503
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:47,784
Dr. Blake, there's...

504
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,540
Last night...

505
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,668
I knew I had to live.

506
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,257
There's so much about myself
that I don't know.

507
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:08,305
Well, desire contradicts fear.

508
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:13,518
These days most people have replaced
almost all their emotions with fear.

509
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,398
When everyone has dreams
but only a few realize them, then...

510
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,653
it makes cowards of the rest of us.

511
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,989
Even if the few are right?

512
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,451
Particularly then.

513
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,376
Veronika, go and get some rest.

514
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,504
I have other patients to attend to.

515
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:48,887
If everyone realized their dreams,
this place would be empty.

516
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,877
The Martians have said
we mustn't study war any more

517
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,006
and must go forth
and bring peace to the nations.

518
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,507
That's what I'm doing!

519
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,260
You think I'm making this up?

520
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,845
It's been reported on CNN!

521
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:33,098
You could hear their words
plain as the nose on your face.

522
01:12:56,956 --> 01:13:00,083
I recall you telling me
that panic attacks aren't fatal,

523
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,294
even if they feel like they are.

524
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,505
"Positive Compassion"...

525
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:10,343
All that text book stuff
is beginning to sound rather old.

526
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,220
Maybe it's time for you
to leave this place.

527
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,889
Oh, don't be so ridiculous.

528
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,767
I do actually help people here,
in case you haven't noticed.

529
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:19,603
Helping people? Like Veronika?

530
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,607
Edward is benefiting, isn't he?

531
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:27,569
Yes, but to get that benefit
you're torturing a dying girl.

532
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,571
Making her recover her will to live,

533
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,698
just when it's too late
to do her any good!

534
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,992
All in the name of research?

535
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,621
Well, it's not a perfect science.

536
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:43,627
Though practically everyone seems
to need me to lie and say that it is.

537
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,965
And when will you finally drop those
tedious notions of right and wrong

538
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:52,010
you've never really
believed in to begin with?

539
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:59,059
Or are you still a lawyer at heart
with fantasies of truth and justice?

540
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:03,355
Look, if Veronika can help Edward

541
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:06,525
by giving him the illusion
he's helping her through love,

542
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:10,278
then her life and death will
not have been completely meaningless.

543
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,072
My God.

544
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,866
Is that the only consolation
you can manage?

545
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:18,036
Anyway...

546
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,956
I made a few phone calls.

547
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:24,459
Found a nice Legal Aid office
on West End Avenue in Manhattan.

548
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,462
No billionaire corporate clients.

549
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,882
Just needy defendants
without a pot to piss in.

550
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,426
Up the block
is a decent take out deli,

551
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:36,012
I can bring my lunch to the park.

552
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:41,685
Who knows? Maybe I'll call up
my ex-husband, see how he's keeping.

553
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:46,606
Well, it all sounds very normal.

554
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:48,900
It's time I got away from you.

555
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:54,239
I mean... from here.

556
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,910
Well yes, like I've been saying,
for how many years is it now?

557
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,210
This is my office address.

558
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:10,755
I'll be staying at my sister's
until I can find a place.

559
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,800
I'll get you a number
when I have one.

560
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,094
Thank you.

561
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:19,681
You could come sit with me
in the park one day.

562
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:24,060
If my schedule lets up, maybe.

563
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,731
Don't hide here forever, Alex.

564
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:00,764
Yeah?

565
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,392
Hey.

566
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,480
Want some help?

567
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,857
You could put those clothes in there.

568
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,318
Okay.
- Thanks.

569
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,995
You know, I heard you last night,

570
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:28,083
playing the piano
in a way I've rarely heard before.

571
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,378
I recognized that you played
with so much soul

572
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,546
because you know you're going to die.

573
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:39,344
I thought, "I'm going to die.
Where's my soul?"

574
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,266
I lost it.

575
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,019
To a husband
and a job and a house

576
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:50,730
I never had the courage to leave.

577
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:55,652
Now, today I feel it again.

578
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:04,119
I wasn't myself last night.

579
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:08,123
Or maybe I really was.

580
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:12,544
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

581
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,549
Some people go their whole lives
searching for one moment

582
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,468
like the one you had
and never achieve it.

583
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,264
You had a thousand in you.

584
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:42,342
Sorry, I-
- It's okay.

585
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,843
It's time for Edward's treatment.

586
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,678
You two can see each other later
in the rec room.

587
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,806
So, what are you
working on there, Ed?

588
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,143
Come on.
It's time for your treatment.

589
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,937
Come on.

590
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:22,298
Why is he here?

591
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,468
Why is he here?

592
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:29,347
Why is he here?

593
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,600
Why is he here?

594
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:49,534
I need to leave Villette.

595
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,208
Are you're talking?

596
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,421
I want to leave.

597
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:08,511
Assistance please.

598
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:11,347
North East Corridor.
Immediate assistance.

599
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,533
It's okay, Ed. It's okay.

600
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,620
Hey, Eddie. Everything okay?

601
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,165
I have to talk to Dr. Blake.

602
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,667
Wow. You're talking up a storm there.

603
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,086
I want to go.

604
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,005
Why don't you take a few of these,
calm down a little bit.

605
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:47,425
You gonna make this a whole big deal?
- Hey, come on. Call Thompson.

606
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,261
Where's Blake? - Off the grounds,
appointment in the city.

607
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,638
You can talk to him
the minute he gets back.

608
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,389
Doctor Thompson.
We need you down here right away.

609
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:55,183
You're just having a little crisis.

610
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:57,060
What's going on?
- No!

611
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,728
What's going on?
- He talked!

612
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:00,563
No!
- Edward, that's wonderful.

613
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,526
Lets get him out of the hallway, okay?
- Angela, relax.

614
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,110
Relax.

615
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,820
Everybody just calm down.

616
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,657
Edward, lets take you to the room.
Okay, relax.

617
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,742
Everybody calm down.
- What are you doing to him?

618
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,578
Veronika!
- Get your hands off!

619
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:18,706
Veronika!
- Everybody get back!

620
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,795
You just spoke.

621
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,928
I think you're important to me.

622
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:36,975
Ed, you need to come with me.
Take him to the room, please.

623
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,685
Do you think Blake
will be okay with this?

624
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,645
We will do the treatment as planned.

625
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:41,813
Go back to your room.

626
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,899
Let's go walking!
Psycho's coming!

627
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,235
Wait!

628
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,779
I'm coming with you.

629
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:52,490
I'm coming with him.

630
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,908
Go.

631
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,953
Go back to your rooms, now!

632
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,077
Hey.

633
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,291
Are you back?

634
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,386
You don't remember, do you?

635
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,490
Veronika.

636
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:11,535
How do you feel?

637
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,039
Like I could live forever.

638
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:55,611
It's like you're part of me now,
like you're inside of me.

639
01:32:57,447 --> 01:33:00,199
You better take good care of me.

640
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,123
It's too cold for you to be out here.

641
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,960
No, I have to see the sunrise.

642
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:14,255
I'm fine.

643
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:37,463
Veronika?

644
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,215
Veronika!

645
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,094
No!

646
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:01,487
Dr. Thompson. Greetings.

647
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:08,243
This office, and Villette,
are now in your care.

648
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:16,001
I hope you will
conduct yourself wisely,

649
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,795
as I've tried to do.

650
01:35:21,341 --> 01:35:23,759
I want to bring you
up to speed on a few things,

651
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:26,178
clear up a few matters.

652
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:41,443
In a few more days
I'd anticipated telling Veronika

653
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:44,738
that our injections
had cured her heart condition.

654
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:48,659
But in light of her unscheduled
departure from Villette,

655
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,912
my telling that particular lie
will not be required.

656
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,669
The majority of people
who attempt suicide

657
01:35:58,795 --> 01:36:02,172
repeat their attempts
until they succeed.

658
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:07,177
I took a risk in lying to her
about her condition.

659
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:12,182
I decided to test the only remedy
I've come to have any faith in.

660
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:17,729
Awareness of life.

661
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:22,234
Hey, look.

662
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:25,988
We made it.

663
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,370
Come here.

664
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:37,749
Until she finds out from some other
doctor that she's perfectly healthy,

665
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,919
she'll consider each day a miracle.

666
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:44,673
Which in my view it is.

667
01:36:45,305 --> 01:37:45,312
